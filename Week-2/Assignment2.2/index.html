                    ReactJS is JavaScript library used for building reusable UI components. According to React official
                    documentation,
                    following is the definition −

                    React is a library for building composable user interfaces. It encourages the creation of reusable
                    UI components, which
                    present data that changes over time. Lots of people use React as the V in MVC. React abstracts away
                    the DOM from you,

                    offering a simpler programming model and better performance. React can also render on the server
                    using Node, and it can
                    power native apps using React Native. React implements one-way reactive data flow, which reduces the
                    boilerplate and is
                    easier to reason about than traditional data binding.<a

                <h2>React Features</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>JSX</b> − JSX is JavaScript syntax extension. It isn't necessary to use JSX in React
                        development,
                        but it
                        is recommended.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Components</b> − React is all about components. You need to think of everything as a
                        component. This
                        will help you maintain
                        the code when working on larger scale projects.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Unidirectional data flow and Flux</b> − React implements one-way data flow which makes it
                        easy to
                        reason
                        about your app.
                        Flux is a pattern that helps keeping your data unidirectional.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>License</b> − React is licensed under the Facebook Inc. Documentation is licensed under CC BY

                </ul>

                <h2>React Advantages</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Uses virtual DOM which is a JavaScript object. This will improve apps performance, since
                        JavaScript
                        virtual DOM is
                        faster than the regular DOM.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Can be used on client and server side as well as with other frameworks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Component and data patterns improve readability, which helps to maintain larger apps.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>React Limitations</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Covers only the view layer of the app, hence you still need to choose other technologies to get
                        a
                        complete tooling set
                        for development.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Uses inline templating and JSX, which might seem awkward to some developers.
                    </li>
